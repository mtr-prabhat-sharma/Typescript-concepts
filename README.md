1.  Union: In Typescript, a union type is a special type which is denoted by pipe symbol (|) in which we can assign multiple types to a single variable.

2. Enums: Enums allows us to define a set of named constants. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

3. Tuples: In TypeScript, a tuple is a data structure that allows you to define an ordered collection of elements, each with a specific type. Tuples are similar to arrays but have a fixed length and the types of their elements are known at compile time
